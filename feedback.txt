Hi Evan. Do you have any of the activities/HW's to submit? I'm very flexible about deadlines given the 
challenges of remote learning (especially for a "lab" course like this that is meant to be in person).
That said, i'm a little worried that you still haven't pushed anything to your repo since our zoom, 
and there's only a month remaining in the semester. 
 
Please let me know when you submit something so I can grade it.

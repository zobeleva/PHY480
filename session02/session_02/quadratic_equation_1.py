# 
#  Program to calculate roots of a quadratic equation:
#      a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
#   as an illustration of subtractive cancellation errors
#
#  Programmer:  Dick Furnstahl  furnstahl.1@osu.edu
#
#  Revision history:
#      27-Dec-2008  original Python version from quadratic_equation_1.cpp
#
#  Notes:
#   * Based on discussion in section 3.4 of Landau/Paez, "Computational
#      Physics"
#   * First pass: no subroutine, calculate all roots, read in a,b,c
#   * C++ version uses single precision to highlight the subtractive 
#       cancellations; Python has double precision only
#
#  To do:
#   * pick out the best roots
#   * make it into a subroutine
#

# 
#  Script to demonstrate that the order of summation of even positive
#   numbers matters

#  Revision history:
#      26-Dec-2008  original Python version from demo1.cpp
#      01-Jan-2011  updated, renamed version
#
#  Notes:
#   * An example to try to understand summing upward vs. summing
#      downward.  Add a small number eps (slightly below single-precision
#      machine precision) many times to 1.  It makes a big difference
#      (in single precision) whether you do 1 + eps + eps + ... or
#      eps + eps + ... + 1.
#
#
#   * First pass: no function definitions
#   * Python has double precision ONLY
#   * Here is the C++ output with eps=5e-8 added 10^7 time:
#
#                           1+eps+eps+...   eps+eps+...+1
#        single precision:  1.0000000000    1.5323836803
#        double precision:  1.4999999992    1.4999999999
#
#  To do:

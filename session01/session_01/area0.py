#
#  This program calculates the area of a circle, given the radius.
#
#  Programmer:  Dick Furnstahl  furnstahl.1@osu.edu

#  Revision history:
#      26-Dec-2008  original version, translated from area.cpp
#
#  Notes:  
#   * run program using "python area.py"
#   * conversion from .cpp to .py:
#        * // --> # for comments on a single line
#        * drop the semicolons
#        * no variable declarations like int or double 
#        * radius**2 instead of radius*radius
#        * different functions for input and output
#
#  To do:
#   * output the answer with higher precision (more digits)
#   * split the calculation into a function (def)
#   * output to a file (and/or input from a file)

#*********************************************************************# 

pi = 3.141592653589793    # put in \pi by hand

answer = raw_input('Enter the radius of a circle: ')  # answer is a string
radius = float(answer)   # convert to floating point number

area = pi * radius**2    # area formula; x**n is x to the n'th power

# simple printing (illustrates that either type of quotes can be used)
print 'radius = ', radius, ', area = ', area
print "radius = ", radius, ", area = ", area
  
# That's all, folks!
